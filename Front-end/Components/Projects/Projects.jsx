                Firstly I read the csv file in using Pandas on Python in a Jupyter notebook and 
                calculated the hourly volume of the departures from Heathrow Airport. The first_seen column
                was initially in a UNIX Time Stamp date format which I converted using to_date and extracted the hour
                with dt.hour. I then plotted the histogram fo the hourly volume using plt.hist with the departures by integer hour
                with 24 hours. I also overlayed this with a normal distribution calculated using the mean and standard deviation from the NumPy 
                library. I also defined a linespace and put this all with the norm.pdf() function for a probability
                density function with plt.plot(). I then plotted the monthly volume of departures as a lineplot for each day in the year in a similar
                way. (see above).

              <div id="project4-3">
                To see the trends and anomalies in the periodicity/cycle of departures throughout the year
                I calculated the logscale of the monthly volume of departures. Firstly I used the np.log() function on the monthly volume
                and plotted it as I did previously. I then calculated the moving average with rolling function logscaled
                monthly departure volume. This was overlayed onto the plot with monthly volume itself. (see above).
              </div>

              <div id="project4-4">
                From the plot with overlayed moving average there are three anomalies two of which in terms days within the year correspond to
                Christmas and Easter (around day 125 and day 205). The other anomaly corresponds to employee strikes (around day 145).

              <div id="project4-5">
                In a similar way I calculated the moving average I also calculated the moving 
                standard deviation by applying the rolling function with the std function on the
                monthly volume. I then overlayed the moving average and moving stadnard deviation on the Original 
                monthly volume. After this I calculated the log difference shift and plotted it.
                I did this by taking away the logscale shift applying the shift() function to the logscale 
                monthly volume from the logscale monthly volume. This was plotted using plt.plot(). 
                (see above).

              <img src={exp_dec_weighted_avg } className="exp_dec_Weighted_avg" />

              <div id="project4-6">
                Next, I calculated the exponential ddecay weighted average of the monthly volume.
                This was done by applying the ewm() function for exponentially weighted calculations
                and inputting the halflife parameter as 12 for 12 months in the year and applying the mean()
                function to calculated the average for the exponetial decay. This was overlayed on the original 
                monthly volume of departures plot. (see above).

              <img src={resid_seasonality} className="resid_seasonality" />

              <div id="project4-7">
                Finally, I plotted the seasonality of the original, trend, seasonality and risiduality
                in a tight layout for comparison. This was done firstly by using the seasonal_decompose function 
                from the statsmodel.tsa.seasonal library, which used the monthly volume logscale data.
                Then .trend, .seasonal and .resid were applied to the decomposition separately and all were plotted
                on separate plots. The residual plot also had rolling mean and rolling standard deviation
                overlayed onto the plot. This showed the seasonality and periodicity in more detail. As well as this 
                the trend plot also showed the anomalies for Christmas, Easter and employee strikes more clearly
                and therefore confirmed my intial hypotheses for why the departures dropped signifcantly
                in the corresponding periods in 2019. (See above).

              <div id='project5-1'>
                This is a full-stack portfolio website developed in the front-end using JavaScript with ThreeJS and React libraries. 
                I used ThreeJS to personalise my website making my own models using Blender and exporting the model as a glb file and imported
                it into the ThreeJS scripts. I developed ThreeJS scenes in the use effect using this model adding textures to to the floor and background (sky)
                in the scene. I also added perspective camera positions and the level of ambient light in the scene.
              </div>

              <img src={threejs_overview} className="threejs_overview" />

              <div id='project5-2'>
                As well as the base scene in the use effect for the Home page I also developed animations closer to the model by using defining the start position and 
                target positions as constants. Aftet his I defined an animate zooom function defining the time elapsed for the zoom, lerpvectors function 
                to alter the camera position in the zoom and finally the lookat function on the position of the model to make sure during the zoom it is focused on the 
                glb model I exported. This zoom is initiated when you click the Home button in the side navbar.

              <div id='project5-3'>
                For the about me page I designed a new model on Blender and again exported the glb file to the directory, importing it into the 
                scene as I did before with the same methods for perspective camera, animation, camera position, spotlight and ambient light.
                Here is where I utilised React to show drop downs for my education background and employment background. Here I defined toggle dropdown functions, using it 
                to dropdown the text when it is clicked as well as integrating hover characteristics. As well as this I defined associated arrow to each dropdown button defining in SCSS
                a rotation of 270 degrees, so it is clear which button is open.

              <div id="project5-4">
                In the same way I developed the About ThreeJS scene with animations and perspective camera, I developed the Projects page which displays
                my technical project portfolio using React. This includes images and descriptions in details of my projects, it is essentially the code as the 
                About page except there are more toggle dropdown buttons with arrows defined for the multiple technical projects I have done.

                Finally on he front end using the same ThreeJS use effect but a different react components to develop a front-end contact form to send emails to 
                my work email account. This was linked to NodeJS back-end which I first tested locally with a server.js and config.js file. To enhance security I utilised
                cert.perm and privkey.pem files with a dedicated passkey to create the http server. I defined exceptions resulting in success or fail messages
                depending if the email is sent successfully or not. I also defined an automated message that it sends to the person who fills out the form when their email is 
                successfully sent. This ensures that the user knows their email has been recieved. I then hosted this on the cloud using render.com.
